The software is a frontend and backend packed application called 'Items List' (title, description), having Ruby on Rails at the backend and React.js on the frontend. The API part just implements basic CRUD operations (get, post, put, delete). 
It was developed based on online tutorial by Hristo Georgiev, that can be found at https://www.pluralsight.com/guides/building-a-crud-interface-with-react-and-ruby-on-rails
